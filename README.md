# EcoLink

EcoLink allows for users to select specific cities in their given state, province, etc. and attend of host campaigns related to sustainability. You can create your own account using our account creation system. All site visitors can see all of the campaigns that have been planned or already completed. If they wish to view the campaigns related to a specific city, they can choose from either the filter or click on that area on the map. Users can only create and join campaigns once they are logged in. With all these features, we can ensure that there will be plenty of sustainability campaigns undertaken, and that it will all be done through the users.
